# Running the server

## nodemon - Keeps the server running, even after backend code changes - refreshes the code automatically
### Install nodemon  <-g> install globally ; <i> short for <install>, you can use either, doesn't really matter ; <nodemon> package name
> npm -g i nodemon 

## Compiling the frontEnd react code for browser use (compile for older browser support)
### Open CMD -> Move into the frontEnd folder, where the frontEnds package.json is
### Run the compile script I have already made in the package json to compile all files in js folder into public_js folder

### <run> run a script ; <jsbuild> script name
> npm run jsbuild


## TODO
# Add auto compile js files to the backend so the workflow would be smoother
